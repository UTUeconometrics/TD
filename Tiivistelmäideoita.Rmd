Along these lines, Caruana et al. (2015) describe a model trained to predict probability of death from
pneumonia that assigned less risk to patients if they also
had asthma. In fact, asthma was predictive of lower risk of
death. This owed to the more aggressive treatment these
patients received. But if the model were deployed to aid
in triage, these patients would then receive less aggressive
treatment, invalidating the model.
